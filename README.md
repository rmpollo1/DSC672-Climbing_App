# DSC672-Climbing_App
A simple dash application used to serve climbing recommendations. The current deployed prototype only offers a single sequence aware recommender model ([CASER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07426)). The model was build off of recorded user climbs obtained from [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) API (depreciated). Most recent user climbs for input to the model come from an SQLite database and thus may not be up to date.
